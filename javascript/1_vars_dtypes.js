// Three ways to declare variables 
var var1 = 'var' // Not block scoped
let var2 = 'var2' // Block scoped
const var3 = 'var3' // Block scoped, can't be changed once defined




// JS has dynamic typing: data types are automatically assigned to variables 
// (we don't have to define the type when devlaring the variable)

// Data Types - Primitive
// Primitive means non-object data types
let number = 1 // Always floating point with a decimal, even if we don't see them
let string = 'string'
let booleanTrue = true
let booleanFalse = false
let Undefined = undefined // automatically assigned to variables that don't have a value assigned
let Null = null

// Data Types - Objects (non-primitives)
let object = {}
let array = []
let func = 'function'

console.log('test' + 1)
